# IND Appointment Checker

Part of the process of obtaining a Dutch Visa through the IND is to provide your biometrics during an appointment at one of 14 locations throughout the Netherlands. One is able to book their appointment here: https://oap.ind.nl/oap/nl/#/BIO. However at the moment there is a huge wait for appointments, and the interface on the website requires one to choose each location with the dropdown and then click through the months to find the next available. As I was willing to travel to just about any centre for my appointment this regular checking was quite tedious and so I made an easier way to programatically check for the earliest available appointment.

The original use of this was simply in the browser console, however now I am making it into a little site, and with further options for custom requirements.

I originally started with the Biometrics appointment, however soon found out that there were other appointments which would benefit from this also. They also used the same calling structure so were easy to fold into this site.
